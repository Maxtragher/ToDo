# ToDo App
<hr>
In this App you can create your to-do list. Each element can be edited,  
moved and deleted.

This is my first Flutter app that will improve as I learn.

I used the following dependencies:

- bloc(cubit) - state managment
- shared_preferences - to simple save a list items
- uuid - to generate string ID of the list items
- flutter_slideble - to design the function of deleting list items
